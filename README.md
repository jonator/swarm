# Swarm: AI-Powered Development Automation

Swarm is an intelligent development automation platform that transforms how teams handle code implementation and project management.

## What is Swarm?

Swarm uses AI-powered agents to automatically:
- Receive and analyze development tasks
- Clone repositories and create feature branches
- Implement code changes
- Run tests and ensure code quality
- Create pull requests
- Integrate with your existing workflow

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Integration**: Works with Linear, GitHub, and Slack
- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Uses advanced AI models to understand context
- **Collaborative Agent System**: Multiple specialized agents work together
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to your team's coding style and preferences
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Elixir/Phoenix for high performance

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```

2. Start the Phoenix server:
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Linear Integration
Mention `@swarm` in a Linear issue to trigger automatic implementation.
