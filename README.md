# Swarm: AI-Powered Development Automation

Swarm is an intelligent development automation platform that transforms how teams handle code implementation and project management.

## What is Swarm?

Swarm uses AI agents to automatically:
- Receive and analyze development tasks
- Clone repositories and create feature branches
- Implement code changes
- Run tests and ensure code quality
- Create pull requests
- Integrate with your existing workflow

## Key Features

- Multi-source integration (Linear, GitHub, Slack)
- Intelligent code generation
- Automatic repository management
- Collaborative AI agent system
- Continuous learning and adaptation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Elixir
- Phoenix
- PostgreSQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `mix setup`
3. Start the server: `mix phx.server`

### Configuration
Set up environment variables for:
- GitHub integration
- Linear integration
- Slack integration
- AI model credentials

## Usage

### Linear Integration
Mention `@swarm` in a Linear issue to trigger automatic implementation.

### GitHub Integration
Create an issue and tag with `@swarm` for automated code changes.

### Slack Integration
Use `@swarm` in Slack threads to request code modifications.
